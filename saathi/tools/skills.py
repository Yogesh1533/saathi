"""Reusable skills: workflows Saathi learns once and runs again by name.

"Save that as my end-of-day skill" stores the steps the model writes plus
the tool calls Saathi actually made in the previous turn; "run my end-of-day
skill" hands those steps back so the model carries them out with its normal
tools. Running a skill grants nothing extra: every step goes through the
same dispatcher and confirmation gate as a spoken request.

Skills are Markdown files with a small header: starter skills ship in
skills/, the user's own live in data/skills/ (a user skill with the same
name replaces a starter). The files are the source of truth and can be
edited by hand.
