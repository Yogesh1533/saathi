"""Pick a Nemotron size for each turn: quick commands go to the small, fast
model, requests that need real reasoning go to the big one, everything
else to the main model. Rule-based on purpose: it costs nothing, adds no
latency, and the HUD can say exactly why a model was chosen.

Only used when the user hasn't pinned a model (settings "model" is "").
